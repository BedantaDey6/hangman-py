HANGMAN GAME - REMADE IN PYTHON!


YOUR GUIDE TO HANGMAN PYTHON - Official Guide made by BEDANTA DEY



1. How to play

Hangman is a game where you guess words before your chances run out. You must have observed that while you type, the drawing of the man gets more and more completed. Once the man's drawing is completed, your chances run out - you lose.

Once you choose your category, try guessing the word. The blanks will be written under the man and above your guess bar. The guess bar also has a INCORRECT GUESSES section which note the characters you have guessed wrong.

That's pretty much it, have fun brainstorming!



2. Source Code

Refer to `hangman_root.py`.


3. How to run
